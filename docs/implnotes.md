# Implementation notes

This file keeps high level technical notes about Xake internals.

## Build model

Xake scripts define rules for targets. During execution, the engine records dependencies and stores build state in `.xake`.

A target is rebuilt when at least one condition is true:

- output does not exist
- dependency files changed
- dependency target was rebuilt
- variable or environment dependency changed
- recipe requests rerun by `alwaysRerun`

## Dependency storage

The build database stores:

- target graph
- requested dependencies
- file list snapshots from filesets
- variable and environment reads

This enables incremental rebuild and `--dryrun` estimation.

## Rules and scheduling

- `<==` demands dependencies in parallel
- `<<<` demands dependencies in sequence
- worker count defaults to CPU core count and can be overridden by `-t`

Parallel execution still respects dependency order.

## Filesets

Filesets support Ant style masks, recursive `**`, and named match groups in rule patterns.

Common behavior:

- path separators `/` and `\\` are accepted
- file list result is tracked as dependency input
- change in resolved file list can trigger rebuild

## Recipe behavior

`recipe` computation supports standard control flow and async style composition with `do!` and `let!`.

Notes:

- `do!` works in `with` blocks
- `do!` does not work in `finally` blocks due to F# computation expression limits
- `WhenError`, `FailWhen`, and `CheckErrorLevel` are available for explicit error flow

## Logging

Xake supports console and file logging with separate verbosity levels.

Log levels:

- `Silent`
- `Quiet`
- `Normal`
- `Loud`
- `Chatty`
- `Diag`

## Runtime and platform

The current repository targets modern `dotnet` workflow with .NET SDK 8.0+ (see `global.json`).

The build script itself always runs on modern .NET. Full framework and Mono are compilation
*targets* handled by the `Xake.Dotnet` tasks; see [dotnet-build.md](dotnet-build.md) for how
that toolchain is discovered and selected.

## Teardown behavior

Teardown rules are defined in script and run during shutdown when engine mode calls `StopAsync`.

In CLI script mode, teardown targets are carried through options and may require explicit demand depending on run mode.
